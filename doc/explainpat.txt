When you want to inspect a given Vim regexp pattern, this script might save
you lots of help lookups.  And it will make the structure of a regexp visible.
And it helps spotting mistakes.

If you find that it explains something wrong, drop me an email.

==============================================================================
						*:ExplainPattern*
:ExplainPattern [{pattern} | {register}]
			parse the given Vim {pattern} and print a line of help
			(with color) for each found pattern item.  Nested
			items get extra indent.

			A single-char argument is used as {register} argument:
				/	explain the last search pattern
				*	explain pattern from the clipboard
				a	explain pattern from register a

Notes:
The pattern is first converted into a purely magic pattern using
|nwo#magic#MakeMagic()|.  This means that embedded |\V| |\M| |\m| |\V|
specifiers are effectively removed from the explanation.

:ExplainPattern also accepts some invalid patterns: >
	:ExplainPattern \)
	Pattern: \)
	\)         end of group
