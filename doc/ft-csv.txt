1. Introduction                                                    *csv-intro*

This plugin is used for handling column separated data with Vim. Usually those
files are called csv files and use the ',' as delimiter, though sometimes they
use e.g. the '|' or ';' as delimiter and there also exists fixedwidth columns.
The aim of this plugin is to ease handling these kinds of files.

This is a filetype plugin for CSV files. It was heavily influenced by
the Vim Wiki Tip667 (http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/VimTip667), though it
works differently. For instructions on installing this file, type
:help add-local-help |add-local-help| inside Vim. For a screenshot, of
how the plugin can be used, see http://www.256bit.org/~chrisbra/csv.gif

==============================================================================
2. Installation						*csv-installation*

In order to have vim automatically detect csv files, you need to have
|ftplugins| enabled (e.g. by having this line in your |.vimrc| file: >

   :filetype plugin on

<
The plugin already sets up some logic, to detect CSV files. By default,
the plugin recognizes *.csv and *.dat files as csv filetype. In order that the
csv filetype plugin is loaded correctly, vim needs to be enabled to load
|filetype-plugins|. This can be ensured, by putting a line like this into your
|.vimrc|: >
    :filetype plugin on
<
(see also |filetype-plugin-on|).

In case this did not work, you need to setup vim like this:

To have Vim automatically detect csv files, you need to do the following.

   1) Create your user runtime directory if you do not have one yet. This 
      directory needs to be in your 'runtime' path. In Unix this would
      typically the ~/.vim directory, while in Windows this is usually your
      ~/vimfiles directory. Use :echo expand("~") to find out, what Vim thinks
      your user directory is. 
      To create this directory, you can do: >

      :!mkdir ~/.vim 
<
      for Unix and >

      :!mkdir ~/vimfiles 
<
      for Windows.

   2) In that directory you create a file that will detect csv files. >

    if exists("did_load_csvfiletype")
      finish
    endif
    let did_load_csvfiletype=1

    augroup filetypedetect
      au! BufRead,BufNewFile *.csv,*.dat	setfiletype csv
    augroup END
<
      You save this file as "filetype.vim" in your user runtime diretory: >

        :w ~/.vim/filetype.vim
<
   3) To be able to use your new filetype.vim detection, you need to restart
      Vim. Vim will then  load the csv filetype plugin for all files whose
      names end with .csv.

==============================================================================
3. Commands							*csv-commands*

The CSV ftplugin provides several Commands:

3.1 WhatColumn                                                *WhatColumn_CSV*
--------------

If you would like to know, on which column the cursor is, use >
    :WhatColumn

Use the bang attribute, if you have a heading in the first line and you want
to know the name of the column in which the cursor is: >
    :WhatColumn!
<

3.2 NrColumns                                                 *NrColumns_CSV*
--------------

:NrColumns outputs the maximum number of columns available. It does this by
testing the first 10 lines for the number of columns. This usually should be
enough.

3.3 SearchInColumn                                          *SearchInColumn_CSV*
------------------

Use :SearchInColumn to search for a pattern within a specific column. The
usage is: >
    :SearchInColumn [<nr>] /{pat}/
<

So if you would like to search in Column 1 for the word foobar, you enter >

    :SearchInColumn 1 /foobar/

Instead of / as delimiter, you can use any other delimiter you like. If you
don't enter a column, the current column will be used.

3.4 HiColumn                                                    *HiColumn_CSV*
------------

:HiColumn <nr> can be used to highlight Column <nr>. Currently the plugin uses
the WildMenu Highlight Group. If you would like to change this, you need to
define the variable |g:csv_hiGroup|.

If you do not specify a <nr>, HiColumn will highlight the column on which the
cursor is. Use >

    :HiColumn!

to remove any highlighting.

If you want to automatically highlight a column, see |csv-hicol|

3.5 ArrangeColumn                                          *ArrangeColumn_CSV*
-----------------

If you would like all columns to be visually arranged, you can use the >
    :ArrangeColumn

command. Beware, that this will change your file and depending
on the size of your file may slow down Vim significantly. This is highly
experimental.
:ArrangeCommand will try to vertically align all columns by their maximum
column size. Note, this can be very slow on large files or many columns (see
|csv-slow| on how to increase performance for this command).
To prevent you from accidently changing your csv file, the buffer will be set
'readonly' afterwards. Note: this command does not work for fixed width
columns |csv-fixedwidth|

3.6 DeleteColumn                                           *DeleteColumn_CSV*
----------------

The command :DeleteColumn can be used to delete a specific column. >

    :DeleteColumn 2

will delete column 2.

If you don't specify a column number, it will delete the column on which the
cursor is.

3.7 InitCSV							*InitCSV*
-----------

Reinitialize the Plugin. Use this, if you have changed the configuration
of the plugin (see |csv-configuration| ).

3.8 Header lines						 *Header_CSV*
----------------

This command splits the csv-buffer and adds a window, that holds a small
fraction of the csv file. This is useful, if the first line contains
some kind of a heading and you want always to display it. This works
similar to fixing a certain line at the top. As optional argument, you
can give the number of columns from the top, that shall be displayed. By
default, 1 is used. Use the '!' to close this window. So this >

    :Header 3

opens at the top a split window, that holds the first 3 lines, is fixed
and horizontally 'scrollbind'ed to the csv window and highlighted using the
CSVHeaderLine highlighting.
To close the header window, use >

    :Header!

Note, this won't work with linebreaks in the column.

Note also, that if you already have a horizontal header window (|VHeader_CSV|),
this command will close the horizontal Header window. This is because of a
limitation of Vim itsself, which doesn't allow to sync the scrolling between
two windows horizontally and at the same time have another window only sync
its scrolling vertically.

Note: this command does not work for fixed width columns |csv-fixedwidth|

							    *VHeader_CSV*

If you want a vertical header line, use :VHeader. This works similar to the
|Header_CSV| command, except that it will open a vertical split window with
the first column always visible. It will always open the first column in the
new split window. Use the '!' to close the window.

Note, this won't work with linebreaks in the column.
Note also: this command does not work for fixed width columns |csv-fixedwidth|


					*VHeaderToggle_CSV* *HeaderToggle_CSV*

Use the :HeaderToggle and :VHeaderToggle command to toggle displaying the
horizontal or vertical header line.


3.9 Sort							*Sort_CSV*
--------

This command can be used to sort the csv file on a certain column. If no range
is given, is sorts the whole file. Specify the column number to sort on as
argument. Use the '!' attribute to reverse the sort order.
For example, the following command sorts line 1 til 10 on the 3 column >

    :1,10Sort 3

While this command >

    :1,10Sort! 3

reverses the order based on column 3.

Instead of a column, you can give the flag 'n' to have it sort numerically.
When no column number is given, it will sort by the column, on which the
cursor is currently.

3.10 Copy Column        					 *Copy_CSV*
----------------

If you need to copy a specific column, you can use the command :Column >

    :[N]Column [a]

Copy column N into register a. If you don't specify N, the column of the
current cursor position is used. If no register is given, the default register
|quotequote| is used. 


3.11 Move A Column        					 *MoveCol_CSV*
------------------

You can move one column behind another column by using the :MoveColumn command >

    :[range]MoveColumn [source] [dest]

This moves the column number source behind column nr destination.
If both arguments are not given, move the column on which the cursor is behind
the last column. If [range] is not given, MoveColumn moves all columns,
otherwise, it moves the columns only for the lines within the range, e.g.
given that your first line is a header line, which you don't want to change >

    :2,$MoveColumn 1 $

this would move column 1 behind the last column, while keeping the header line
as is.


3.12 Sum of a Column        					 *SumCol_CSV*
--------------------

You can let Vim output the sum of a column using the :SumCol command >

    :[range]SumCol [nr]

This outputs the result of the column <nr> within the range given. If no range
is given, this will calculate the sum of the whole column. If <nr> is not
given, this calculate the sum for the column the cursor is on. See also
|csv-aggregate-functions|


3.13 Normal mode commands					 *csv-motion*
-------------------------

The csv filetype plugin redefines the following keys as:

<C-Right> or L or W	Move [count] field forwards

<C-Left> or E or H	Move [count] field backwards

<Up> or K		Move [count] lines upwards within the same column

<Down> or J		Move [count] lines downwards within the same column


                                                            *ConvertData_CSV*
3.14 Converting a CSV File					 *csv-convert*
--------------------------

You can convert your CSV file to a different format with the command >

    ConvertData

Use the the ! attribute, to convert your data without the delimiter.

This command will interactively ask you for the definition of 3 variables.
After which it will convert your csv file into a new format, defined by those
3 variables and open the newly created file in a new window. Those 3 variables
define how the text converted.

First, You need to define what has to be done, before converting your column
data. That is done with the "pre convert" variable. The content of this
variable will be put in front of the new document.

Second, you define, what has to be put after the converted content of your
column data. This happens with the "post convert" variable. Basically the
contents of this variable will be put after processing the columns.

Last, the columns need to be converted into your format. For this you can
specify a printf() format like string, that defines how your data will be
converted. You can use '%s' to specify placeholders, which will later be
replaced by the content of the actual column. 

For example, suppose you want to convert your data into HTML, then you first
call the >

    ConvertData

At this point, Vim will ask you for input. First, you need to specify, what
needs to be done before processing the data:

Pre convert text: <html><body><table>`

This would specify to put the HTML Header before the actual data can be
processed. If the variable g:csv_pre_convert is already defined, Vim will
already show you its' content as default value. Simply pressing Enter will use
this data. After that, Vim asks, what the end of the converted file needs to
look like:

Post convert text: </table></body></html>

So here you are defining how to finish up the HTML file. If the variable
g:csv_post_convert is already defined, Vim will already show you its' content
as default value which you can confirm by pressing Enter. Last, you define,
how your columns need to be converted. Again, Vim asks you for how to do that:

Converted text, use %s for column input:
<tr><td>%s</td><td>%s</td><td>%s</td></tr>

This time, you can use '%s' expandos. They tell Vim, that they need to be
replaced by the actual content of your file. It does by going from the first
column in your file and replacing it with the corresponding %s in that order.
If there are less '%s' expandos then columns in your file, Vim will skip the
columns, that are not used. Again If the variable g:csv__convert is already
defined, Vim will already show you its' content as default value which you can
confirm by pressing Enter. 

After you hit Enter, Vim will convert your data and put it into a new window.
It may look like this:

    <html><body><table> `
    <tr><td>1,</td><td>2,</td><td>3,</td></tr> `
    <tr><td>2,</td><td>2,</td><td>4,</td></tr> `
    </table></body></html> `

Note, this is only a proof of concept. A better version of converting your
data to HTML is bundled with Vim (|:TOhtml|).

But may be you want your data converted into SQL-insert statements. That could
be done like this: >
    
    ConvertData!
    Pre convert text: `

(Leave this empty. It won't be used).

    Post convert text: Commit;`

After inserting the data, commit it into the database.

    Converted text, use %s for column input: `
    Insert into table foobar values ('%s', '%s', %s); `

Note, that the last argument is not included within single quotation marks,
since in this case the data is assumed to be integer and won't need to be
quoted for the database.

After hitting Enter, a new Window will be opened, which might look like this:

Insert into table foobar values('Foobar', '2', 2011);
Insert into table foobar values('Bar', '1', 2011);
...
Commit;           

Since the command was used with the bang attribute (!), the converted data
doesn't include the column delimiters.

Now you can copy it into your database, or further manipulate it.

==============================================================================
4. CSV Configuration					 *csv-configuration*

The CSV plugin tries to automatically detect the field delimiter for your
file, cause although often the file is called CSV (comma separated values), a
semicolon is actually used. The column separator is stored in the buffer-local
variable b:delimiter. This delimiter is heavily used, because you need
it to define a column. Almost all commands use this variable therefore.

4.1 Delimiter							*csv-delimiter*
-------------

To override the automatic detection of the plugin and define the separator
manually, use: >

    :let g:csv_delim=','

to let the comma be the delimiter. This sets the buffer local delimiter
variable b:delimiter.

If your file does not consist of delimited columns, but rather is a fixed
width csv file, see |csv-fixedwidth| for configuring the plugin appropriately.

If you changed the delimiter, you should reinitiliaze the plugin using
|InitCSV|

4.2 Column							*csv-column*
----------

The definition, of what a column is, is defined as buffer-local variable
b:col. By default this variable is initialized to: >

    let b:col='\%(\%([^' . b:delimiter . ']*"[^"]*"[^' . b:delimiter . ']*'
    \. b:delimiter . '\)\|\%([^' . b:delimiter . ']*\%(' . b:delimiter 
    \. '\|$\)\)\)'

This should take care of quoted delimiters within a column. Those should
obviously not count as a delimiter. This regular expression is quite
complex and might not always work on some complex cases (e.g. linebreaks
within a field, see RFC4180 for some ugly cases that will probably not work
with this plugin).

If you changed the b:delimiter variable, you need to redefine the b:col
variable, cause otherwise it will not reflect the change. To change the
variable from the comma to a semicolon, you could call in your CSV-Buffer
this command: >

    :let b:col=substitute(b:col, ',', ';', 'g')

Check with :echo b:col, if the definition is correct afterwards.

You can also force the plugin to use your own defined regular expression as
column. That regular expression should include the delimiter for the columns. 
To define your own regular expression, set the g:csv_col variable: >

    let g:csv_col='[^,]*,'

This defines a column as a field delimited by the comma (where no comma can be
contained inside a field), similar to how |csv-strict| works.

You should reinitialize the plugin afterwards |InitCSV|

4.3 Highlighting Group                                         *csv-higroup*
----------------------

By default the csv ftplugin uses the WildMenu highlighting Group to define how
the |HiColumn| command highlights columns. If you would like to define a
different highlighting group, you need to set this via the g:csv_hiGroup
variable. You can e.g. define it in your |.vimrc|: >

    :let g:csv_hiGroup = "IncSearch"

You need to restart Vim, if you have changed this variable or use |InitCSV|

The |hl-Title| highlighting is used for the Header line that is created by the
|Header_CSV| command. If you prefer a different highlighting, set the
g:csv_hiHeader variable to the prefered highlighting: >

    let g:csv_hiHeader = 'Pmenu'
<
This would set the header window to the |hl-Pmenu| highlighting, that is used
for the popup menu. To disable the custom highlighting, simply |unlet| the
variable: >

    unlet g:csv_hiHeader

You should reinitialize the plugin afterwards |InitCSV|

4.4 Strict Columns						*csv-strict*
------------------

The default regular expression to define a column is quite complex
|csv-column|. This slows down the processing and makes Vim use more memory and
it could still not fit to your specific use case.

If you know, that in your data file, the delimiter cannot be contained inside
the fields quoted or escaped, you can speed up processing (this is quite
noticeable when using the |ArrangeColumn_CSV| command) by setting the
g:csv_strict_columns variable: >

    let g:csv_strict_columns = 1

This would define a column as this regex: >

    let b:col = '\%([^' . b:delimiter . ']*' . b:delimiter . '\|$\)'

Much simpler then the default column definition, isn't it?
See also |csv-column| and |csv-delimiter|

You can disable the effect if you |unlet| the variable: >

    unlet g:csv_strict_columns

You should reinitialize the plugin afterwards |InitCSV|

4.5 Multibyte Chars						*csv-mbyte*
-------------------

Unfortunately, when using the |ArrangeColumn_CSV| command, multibyte chars
make some trouble, because internally Vim uses bytes to specify the width of a
column. The CSV plugin tries to workaround that, by calculating the byte width
of each column, before aligning them. This is quite expensive and can slow
down processing. If you know, your data file only contains pure ASCII chars
(or you simply don't care, if some lines a off a little bit), set the
g:csv_no_multibyte variable: >

    let g:csv_no_multibyte = 1

And to force calculating the byte width of each column |unlet| the variable: >

    unlet g:csv_no_multibyte

You should reinitialize the plugin afterwards |InitCSV|

4.6 Concealing					*csv-syntax*	*csv-conceal*
-------------------

The CSV plugin comes with a function to syntax highlight csv files. Basically
allt it does is highlight the columns and the header line.

By default, the delimiter will not be displayed, if Vim supports |conceal| of
syntax items and instead draws a vertical line. If you don't want that, simply
set the g:csv_noconceal variable in your .vimrc >
    
    let g:csv_no_conceal = 1

and to disable it, simply unlet the variable >

    unlet g:csv_no_conceal

You should reinitialize the plugin afterwards |InitCSV|

If you want to customize the syntax colors, you can define your own groups.
The CSV plugin will use already defined highlighting groups, if they are
already defined, otherwise it will define its own defaults which should be
visible with 8, 16, 88 and 256 color terminals. For that it uses the
CSVColumnHeaderOdd and CSVColumnHeaderEven highlight groups for syntax
coloring the first line. All other lines get either the CSVColumnOdd or
CSVColumnEven highlighting.

In case you want to define your own highlighting groups, you can define your
own syntax highlighting like this in your |.vimrc| >

    hi CSVColumnEven term=bold ctermbg=4 guibg=DarkBlue
    hi CSVColumnOdd  term=bold ctermbg=5 guibg=DarkMagenta
    hi CSVColumnHeaderEven ...
    hi CSVColumnHeaderOdd ...

<

Note, these changes won't take effect, until you restart Vim.


4.7 Newlines						*csv-newline*
------------

RFC4180 allows newlines in double quoted strings. By default, the csv-plugin
won't recognize newlines inside fields. It is however possible to make the
plugin aware of newlines within quoted strings. To enbale this, set >

    let g:csv_nl = 1

and to disable it again, simply unset the variable >

    unlet g:csv_nl

It is a good idea to reinitialize the plugin afterwards |InitCSV|

Note, this might not work correctly in all cases. The syntax highlighting
seems to change on cursor movements. This could possibly be a bug in the
syntax highlighting engine of Vim. Also, |WhatColumn_CSV| can't handle
newlines inside fields and will most certainly be wrong. 

4.8 Highlight column automatically				*csv-hicol* 
----------------------------------

You can let vim automatically highlight the column on which the cursor is.
This works by defining an |CursorMoved| autocommand to always highlight the
column, when the cursor is moved in normal mode. Note, this does not update
the highlighting, if the Cursor is moved in Insert mode. To enable this, 
define the g:csv_highlight_column variable like this >

    let g:csv_highlight_column = 'y'

and to disable it again, simply unset the variable >

    unlet g:csv_highlight_column

It is a good idea to reinitialize the plugin afterwards |InitCSV|

4.9 Fixed width columns                                        *csv-fixedwidth*
-----------------------

Sometimes there are no real columns, but rather the file is fixed width with
no distinct delimiters between each column. The CSV plugin allows you to
handle such virtual columns like csv columns, if you define where each column
starts. You can do this, by setting the buffer-local variable
b:csv_fixed_width like this >

    let b:csv_fixed_width="1,5,9,13,17,21"

This defines that each column starts at multiples of 4. Be sure, to issue this
command in the buffer, that contains your file, otherwise, it won't have an
effect, since this is a buffer-local option (|local-option|)

Except for |ArrangeColumn_CSV| and the |Header_CSV| commands, all commands
work in either mode. Those two commands won't do anything in the case of
fixedwidth columns, since they don't really make sense here.

After setting this variable, you should reinitialize the plugins using
|InitCSV|

==============================================================================
5. CSV Tips and Tricks						*csv-tips*

Here, there you'll find some small tips and tricks that might help when
working with CSV files.

5.1 Statusline							*csv-stl*
--------------
Suppose you want to include the column, on which the cursor is, into your
statusline. You can do this, by defining in your .vimrc the 'statusline' like
this: >

    function MySTL()
	if has("statusline")
	    hi User1 term=standout ctermfg=0 ctermbg=11 guifg=Black guibg=Yellow
	    let stl = ...
	    if exists("*CSV_WCol")
		let csv = '%1*%{&ft=~"csv" ? CSV_WCol() : ""}%*'
	    else
		let csv = ''
	    endif
	    return stl.csv
	endif
    endfunc
    set stl=%!MySTL()
<

This will draw in your statusline right aligned the current column and max
column (like 1/10), if you are inside a CSV file. The column info will be
drawn using the User1 highlighting (|hl-User1|), that has been defined in the
second line of the function. In the third line of your function, put your
desired 'statusline' settings as |expression|. Note the section starting with
'if exists(..)' guards against not having loaded the filetype plugin.


5.2 Slow ArrangeCol						*csv-slow*
-------------------

Processing a csv file using |ArrangeColumn_CSV| can be quite slow, because Vim
needs to calculate the width for each column and then replace each column by
itself widened by spaces to the optimal length. Unfortunately, csv files tend
to be quite big. Remember, for a file with 10,000 lines and 50 columns Vim
needs to process each cell, which accumulates to 500,000 substitutions. It
might take some time, until Vim is finished.

Here are some performance meassurements on how the various
configuration settings influence the |ArrangeColumn_CSV| command on a file
with 34 columns (on a 2.2GHz Core2Duo processor):

¹ setting the g:csv_strict_columns variable (|csv-strict|)
² setting the g:csv_no_multibyte variable (|csv-mbyte|)
³ setting the g:csv_no_multibyte variable and g:csv_strict_columns variable

Note, this was performed on a quite fast processor. If you need to work with
large files, be sure to have enough memory available, cause Vim needs to read
in the whole file into memory. You can also try the LargeFile plugin available
at http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1506 which tunes several
Vim options (like |syn-off|, 'undolimits', 'fdm' and others).



5.3 Defining custom aggregate functions		    *csv-aggregate-functions*
---------------------------------------

The CSV plugin already defines the |SumCol_CSV|command, to let you calculate
the sum of all values of a certain column within a given range. But it may be,
that you don't need the sum, but would rather want to have the average of all
values within a certain column. You can define your own function and let the
plugin call it for a column like this:

    1) You define your own custom function in the after directory of your
       vimruntime path |after-directory| (see also #2 below) >

	fun! My_CSV_Average(col)
	    let sum=0
	    for item in a:col
		let sum+=item
	    endfor
	    return sum/len(a:col)
	endfun
<
       This function takes a list as argument, and calculates the average for
       all items in the list. You could also make use of Vim's |eval()|
       function and write your own Product function like this >

	fun! My_CSV_Product(col)
	    return eval(join(a:col, '*'))
	endfun
<

    2) Now define your own custom command, that calls your custom function for
    a certain column >
       
	    command! -buffer -nargs=? -range=% AvgCol
	    \ :echo csv#EvalColumn(<q-args>,
	    \ "My_CSV_Average", <line1>,<line2>)
<
        This command should best be put into a file called csv.vim and put
	into your ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/ directory. Create directories that
	don't exist yet. For Windows, this would be the
	$VIMRUNTIME/vimfiles/after/ftplugin directory.

    3) Make sure, your |.vimrc| includes a filetype plugin setting like this >

	filetype plugin on
<
       This should make sure, that all the necessary scripts are loaded by
       Vim.

    After restarting Vim, you can now use your custom command definition
    :AvgCol. Use a range, for the number of lines you want to evaluate and
    optionally use an argument to specify which column you want to be
    evaluated >

	:2,$AvgCol 7
<
    This will evaluate the average of column seven (assuming, line 1 is the
    header line, which should not be taken into account).
