1. potwiki Installation                                     *potwiki-install*

    In order to install the plugin, place the potwiki.vim file into a plugin
    directory in your runtime path (please see |add-global-plugin| and
    |'runtimepath'|).

    |potwiki| may be customized by setting variables, creating maps, and
    specifying event handlers.  Please see |potwiki-customize| for more
    details.

                                                           *potwiki-auto-help*
    This help file is automagically generated when the |potwiki| script is
    loaded for the first time.

==============================================================================
1.1. potwiki requirements                              *potwiki-requirements*

    potwiki should work with vim 6.0 or later versions.

==============================================================================
2. potwiki intro                                                   *potwiki*
                                                       *wiki*  *potwiki-intro*

   potwiki provides functions and mappings for maintaining a Wiki of plain
   text files.

   The Wiki is a collection of text files in a single directory. These files
   can contain hyper links to each other in the form of WikiWords.

   A WikiWord is a word which starts with an upper case letter and contains
   at least one lower case letter and another upper case letter in this
   order -- it's in 'camel case', e.g.

     ThisIsAWikiWord

   Such a WikiWord links to a file of exactly the same name in your
   Wiki directory.

   By default you can also use digits and underscore in your WikiWords.
   You can customize this to your needs. |potwiki-customize|

   When opening a Wiki file potwiki scans your Wiki directory to find
   which WikiWords are valid links. WikiWords without a corresponding
   file are highlighted as errors (otherwise it doesn't matter).

   The default mappings are defined as follow (By default, <Leader> stands
   for '\'. See |Leader| for more info) :

   <Leader>ww   - open the Wiki HomePage
   <Leader>wi   - open the Wiki index
   <Leader>wf   - follow a WikiWord (can be used in any buffer!)
   <Leader>we   - edit a Wiki file

   The following mappings are present when editing a Wiki file:

   <Leader><Leader> - close the file
   <CR>             - follow the WikiWord under the cursor
   <Tab>            - move to the next WikiWord
   <BS>             - move to the previous WikiWord
   <Leader>wr       - reload WikiWords

   See |potwiki-mappings-override| and |potwiki-options| to learn how to
   override those default mappings.

==============================================================================
3. potwiki commands	                                    *potwiki-commands*

    See |potwiki-intro| for default mapping.

    Currently potwiki does not define any commands.

==============================================================================
4. potwiki customization                                  *potwiki-customize*

4.1. General configuration      ~
--------------------------
                                          *loaded_potwiki*  *potwiki-disable*
    You can disable this script by putting the following line in your |vimrc| >
      let loaded_potwiki = 1
<

    You can define your own color scheme for potwiki highlighting, by setting
    |highlight| on PotwikiWord and PotwikiWordNotFound groups. For example: 
>
      highlight PotwikiWord          guifg=darkcyan
      highlight PotwikiWordNotFound  guibg=Red guifg=Yellow
<
    When a wiki file is edited the 'filetype' and 'syntax' options are set 
    to 'potwiki'. You can use autocommands for this filetype to customize
    your wiki editing. For exmaple:
>
      :au Filetype potwiki set sts=4
<
    If you want to be able to switch the highlighting on and off with
>
      :syntax on | enable | off
<
    put the following line in a file called 'potwiki.vim' in your syntax
    directory (usually ~/.vim/syntax):
>
      call PotwikiSyntax()
<

4.2. Mapping documentation:      ~
---------------------------
                                                   *potwiki-mappings-override*
    By default, a global mapping is defined for some commands.  User-provided
    mappings can be used instead by mapping to <Plug>CommandName. This is
    especially useful when these mappings collide with other existing mappings
    (vim will warn of this during plugin initialization, but will not clobber
    the existing mappings).

    For instance, to override the default mapping for :PotwikiHome to set it to
    \wh, add the following to the |vimrc|:
>
      nmap \wh <Plug>PotwikiHome
<
4.3. Options documentation:      ~
---------------------------
                                                             *potwiki-options*
    Several variables are checked by the script to customize potwiki
    behavior. You can set them using let in your |vimrc| file.
    Example:
>
        let potwiki_home = "$HOME/MyWiki/HomePage"
<
    potwiki_home                                                *potwiki_home*
      This variable contains the filename of your Wiki HomePage.
      default: $HOME/Wiki/HomePage

    potwiki_home_dir                                        *potwiki_home_dir*
      This variable contains the path of your Wiki directory.
      default: the directory containing the file set in potwiki_home.

    potwiki_upper                                              *potwiki_upper*
      Upper case characters for WikiWords. Uses the syntax of [ ] atoms
      in regular expressions. 
      default: 'A-Z'

    potwiki_lower                                              *potwiki_lower*
      Lower case characters for WikiWords. Uses the syntax of [ ] atoms
      in regular expressions. 
      default: 'a-z'

    potwiki_other                                              *potwiki_other*
      Non-letter characters for WikiWords. Uses the syntax of [ ] atoms
      in regular expressions. 
      default: '0-9_'

    potwiki_autowrite                                      *potwiki_autowrite*
      If this is non-zero potwiki always writes a Wiki file when it
      is closed by <Plug>PotwikiClose or when you follow another WikiWord.
      (The file is only written if it has been changed.)

    potwiki_ignore                                            *potwiki_ignore*
      A comma-separated list of words you don't want potwiki to
      highlight. Don't include any whitespace in this list.
      default: ''
