2. Functionality

This plugin was written to allow you to save your |signs| easily. Signs can be
used to specific highlight certains rows in a buffer. This might be useful
when using a debugger or display a |mark|. Note however, that this works only
when the signs feature has been compiled into your vim.

If you have defined signs in your file, you might want to save these signs to
be able to reload these signs later on (e.g. with a |Session|). Therefore this
plugin defines the |:SaveSigns| command, which will store all defined signs in
a file in such a way that reloading that file will restore all defined signs.

When saving Signs, the plugin creates a Vim Script, that can be read in using
|:source| It will save Sign Definitions (see |:sign-define|), Sign placements
(see |:sign-place|) and the Sign hilighting (see |hl-SignColumn|).

Since signs are usually associated with a buffer or a file, sourcing this file
using |:source| will only restore those signs whose buffers are loaded in that
vim session. Note: All Signs that were defined before reloading this file will
be lost.

2.1 :SaveSigns							*:SaveSigns*

:SaveSigns		Store all currently defined signs in a temporary file.
			This file will be opened in a new split window and you
			can edit it further. Note: This file won't be saved.
			You need to explicitly save it.

:SaveSigns[!] {name}	Store all currently defined signs in a file called
			{name}. If this file exists, it won't be used a new
			temporary file will be created. Use ! to force storing
			the info in that file. This will however erase the
			file {name}. So use with caution.
