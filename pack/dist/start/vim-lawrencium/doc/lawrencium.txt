=============================================================================
1.  Introduction                                *lawrencium-intro*

When a file from a Mercurial repository is open in a buffer, that buffer gets
new commands defined.

This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set.

=============================================================================
2.  Commands                                    *lawrencium-commands*

All commands defined by |lawrencium| are local to each buffer.

                                                *:Hg*
:Hg {args}              Run an arbitrary Mercurial command. Similar to :!hg
                        [args] but the '--repository' is automatically
                        specified with the root of the repository the current
                        file belongs to, and it will auto-complete any
                        standard command or option.
                        
                        Also, unless the |lawrencium_auto_cd| global is set to
                        `0`, it will temporarily set the current directory to be
                        the root of the repository so that auto-completed
                        filenames work out of the box.

                                                *:Hg!*
:Hg! {args}             Like |:Hg|, but the output of the command is placed in
                        a temp file and edited in a split window.

                        Once the output is open in a buffer, Lawrencium will
                        try to set the file type according to the Mercurial
                        command that was run. See |lawrencium_hg_commands_file_types|.

                                                *:Hgcd*
:Hgcd[!] {path}         |:cd| relative to the root of the repository.

                                                *:Hglcd*
:Hglcd[!] {path}        |:lcd| relative to the root of the repository.

                                                *:Hgedit*
:Hgedit {file}          |:edit| {file} relative to the root of the repository.

                                                *:Hgedit!*
:Hgedit! {file}         |:edit!| {file} relative to the root of the repository.

                                                *:Hgstatus*
:Hgstatus               Shows the output of 'hg status' in a split window.
                        Some extra-commands, along with some default mappings,
                        are available in this window. See
                        |lawrencium-status-window|.

                                                *:Hgdiff*
:Hgdiff                 Diffs the current file against its parent revision.
                        This splits the current window to show both the
                        current file and the parent revision file, using Vim's
                        |diff| abilities.

                                                *:Hgdiff_f*
:Hgdiff {revspec}       Same as |:Hgdiff| but shows a diff of the current file
                        with the specified revision. Any revision number, hash
                        or spec that can be passed to `hg cat` is valid.

                                                *:Hgvdiff*
:Hgvdiff                Same as |:Hgdiff| but uses a vertical split instead of
                        a horizontal split.

                                                *:Hgvdiff_f*
:Hgvdiff {revspec}      Same as |:Hgdiff_f| but uses a vertical split.

                                                *:Hgtabdiff*
:Hgtabdiff              Same as |:Hgdiff| but opens the diff with a vertical
                        split in a new tab page.

                                                *:Hgtabdiff_f*
:Hgtabdiff {revspec}    Same as |:Hgdiff_f| but opens the diff with a vertical
                        split in a new tab page.

                                                *:Hgdiffsum*
:Hgdiffsum              Shows the "diff summary" (the output of `hg diff`)
                        of the current file against its parent revision.

                                                *:Hgdiffsum_f*
:Hgdiffsum {revspec}    Same as |:Hgdiffsum| but shows a "diff summary" of the
                        current file with the specified revision. Any revision
                        number, hash or spec that can be passed to `hg diff`
                        is valid.

                                                *:Hgdiffsumsplit*
                                                *:Hgdiffsumsplit_f*
:Hgdiffsumsplit
:Hgdiffsumsplit {revspec}
                        Same as |:Hgdiffsum| and |:Hgdiffsum_f| respectively, 
                        but opens the diff summary in a split window instead
                        of the current window.

                                                *:Hgvdiffsumsplit*
                                                *:Hgvdiffsumsplit_f*
:Hgvdiffsumsplit
:Hgvdiffsumsplit {revspec}
                        Same as |:Hgdiffsumsplit| and |:Hgdiffsumsplit_f|
                        respectively, but uses a vertical split window instead
                        of a horizontal split window.

                                                *:Hgtabdiffsumsplit*
                                                *:Hgtabdiffsumsplit_f*
:Hgtabdiffsumsplit
:Hgtabdiffsumsplit {revspec}
                        Same as |:Hgdiffsumsplit| and |:Hgdiffsumsplit_f|
                        respectively, but opens the diff summary with a
                        vertical split in a new tab page.

                                                *:Hgcommit*
:Hgcommit               Opens a new window to edit a commit message into a
                        temporary file and, upon quitting the buffer, if that
                        file has been written to, commit the current changes
                        to the repository.

                                                *:Hgvcommit*
:Hgvcommit              Same as |:Hgcommit| but uses a vertical split to edit
                        the commit message.

:Hgrevert {files}                               *:Hgrevert*
                        Reverts the given files (in repo-relative paths). If no
                        file are given, reverts the current file.

:Hgrevert! {files}                              *:Hgrevert!*
                        Same as |:Hgrevert| but with the --no-backup option
                        given to prevent a .orig backup file from being
                        created.

                                                *:Hglog*
:Hglog
                        Opens the history (log) for the current repository
                        in the |preview-window|. Some extra-commands, along with 
                        some default mappings, are available in this window.
                        See |lawrencium-log-window|. In addition, you can pass
                        the usual hg log arguments like -u username, -l limit, etc.

                                                *:Hglog_f*
:Hglog {file}           Same as |:Hglog|, but opens the log for the specified
                        file or direcotry instead of the whole repository.

                                                *:Hglogthis*
:Hglogthis              Same as |:Hglog| but opens the history (log) for the
                        currently edited file instead of the whole repository.

                                                *:Hglogexport*
:Hglogexport            Exports the commit under cursor to directory specified by
                        env variable HG_EXPORT_PATCH_DIR. If this variable is not
                        set, then it is exported to the current working directory
                        of vim. On Unix, if the user specified an absolute path,
                        then the env variable is ignored.

                                                *:Hgannotate*
:Hgannotate             Splits the current window to show annotations in the
                        left window. These annotation are retrieved with `hg
                        annotate`.
                        If the current file has local edits, the full output
                        of `hg annotate` will be opened instead, which is the
                        annotated parent revision.
                        Some extra-commands, along with some default mappings,
                        are available in this window.
                        See |lawrencium-annotate-window|.

                                                *:Hgannotate_f*
:Hgannotate {file}      Same as |:Hgannotate|, but opens {file} first with
                        |:Hgedit|.

                                                *:Hgannotate!_f*
:Hgannotate! {file}     Same as |:Hgannotate_f|, but opens {file} with
                        |:Hgedit!|.

                                                *:Hgwannotate*
:Hgwannotate            Same as |:Hgannotate|, but runs the command in
                        `verbose` mode to get full user names and time of day.
                        This results in a wider annotation column next to the
                        file (hence the command name: "Hg wide annotate").

                                                *:Hgwannotate_f*
:Hgwannotate {file}     Same as |:Hgwannotate|, but opens {file} first with
                        |:Hgedit|.

                                                *:Hgwannotate!_f*
:Hgwannotate! {file}    Same as |:Hgwannotate_f|, but opens {file} with
                        |:Hgedit!|.

                                                *:Hgvimgrep*
:Hgvimgrep              Runs a |:vimgrep| command inside the current
                        repository. The files in which to search can be
                        provided with repository-relative names. If no file is
                        given, the search will be run in the whole repository.

                                                *:Hgqseries*
:Hgqseries              If you have the 'mq' extension enabled, show the
                        current patch series, with indicators about which
                        patches are applied, and which ones are not.

3.  Status Window                               *lawrencium-status-window*

The `hg status` window opened by Lawrencium has a few special commands 
defined in it. Also, unless the global |lawrencium_define_mappings| is set to
`0`, some commands are mapped to keyboard shortcuts, as detailed in the
following descriptions.


                                                *:Hgstatusedit*
:Hgstatusedit           Open the file mentioned on the current line.
                        Mapped to <CR>.

                                                *:Hgstatusaddremove*
:Hgstatusaddremove      Run `hg addremove` on the file mentioned on the
                        current line, or on the lines currently selected in
                        visual selection mode (see |visual-start|).
                        Mapped to <CTRL-A>.

                                                *:Hgstatusdiff*
:Hgstatusdiff           Open a diff window on the file mentioned on the
                        current line, between the working directory version
                        and the parent revision version. Similar to running
                        |:Hgdiff| on that file.

                                                *:Hgstatusvdiff*
:Hgstatusvdiff          Similar to |:Hgstatusdiff|, but use a vertical split.
                        Similar to running |:Hgvdiff| on that file.
                        Mapped to <CTRL-V>.

                                                *:Hgstatustabdiff*
:Hgstatustabdiff        Similar to |:Hgstatusdiff|, but opens the split with a
                        vertical split in a new tab page.
                        Similar to running |:Hgtabdiff| on that file.

:Hgstatusdiffsum        Similar to |:Hgstatusdiff|, but show a diff summary,
                        like the one shown with |:Hgdiffsum|, instead of
                        running a full Vim diff.
                        Mapped to <CTRL-U>.

:Hgstatuscommit         Runs |:Hgcommit| on the files currently mentioned in
                        the buffer, or in the current selection. The first 
                        option means you can delete lines from the buffer
                        until the remaining filenames are those you want to
                        commit.

                        patch with the file currently mentioned in the buffer,
                        or in the current selection. You must give a patch name,
                        and may optionally write a commit message for the patch
                        (without surrounding quotes).

A few other mappings are available in the status window:

   <C-N>                Jump to the next filename.
   <C-P>                Jump to the previous filename.
   q                    Quit the status window.

4.  Log Window                                  *lawrencium-log-window*
                        
The `hg log` window opened by Lawrencium has a few special commands 
defined in it. Also, unless the global |lawrencium_define_mappings| is set to
`0`, some commands are mapped to keyboard shortcuts, as detailed in the
following descriptions.

                                                *:Hglogdiffsum*
:Hglogdiffsum           Splits the previous window to show a diff summary (as
                        returned by `hg diff`) of the change specified on
                        the current line.
                        Mapped to |<C-U>|.

                                                *:Hglogdiffsum_r*
:Hglogdiffsum {rev1} {rev2}
                        Same as |:Hglogdiffsum| but shows a diff summary of
                        the change between the two specified revisions. If
                        only {rev1} is specified, the change at that revision
                        will be shown.

:Hglogtabdiffsum {rev1} {rev2}
                        Same as |:Hglogdiffsum| and |:Hglogdiffsum_r| but
                        opens the diff summary in a new tab page.

                                                *:Hglogrevedit*
:Hglogrevedit           Looks at the revision specified on the current line,
                        and opens that revision for edit in the previous
                        window (although as a read-only buffer).
                        This is only valid if the logged path maps to a file
                        (i.e. not a directory, and not the whole repository as
                        with |:Hglog|).
                        Mapped to |<C-E>|.

                                                *:Hglogdiff*
:Hglogdiff              Looks at the revision specified on the current line,
                        and opens a Vim diff between that revision and its
                        first parent.
                        This is only valid if the logged path maps to a file
                        (i.e. not a directory, and not the whole repository as
                        with |:Hglog|).
                        Mapped to |<C-D>|.

                        Same as |:Hglogdiff|, but opens a diff between the
                        specified revisions. If only {rev1} is specified,

:Hglogvdiff {rev1} {rev2}
                        Same as |:Hglogdiff_r| but opens a vertical split
                        instead of a horizontal one.

                                                *:Hglogtabdiff*

                        diff with a vertical split in a new tab page.

                                                *lawrencium-log-mappings*
A few other mappings are available in the log window:

7.  Global Settings                             *lawrencium-global-settings*

The following global settings can be defined in your |vimrc| to change the
default behaviour of Lawrencium.

                                                *lawrencium_hg_executable*
g:lawrencium_hg_executable
                        Defines the executable to run when running Mercurial
                        commands.
                        Defaults to simply `hg`.

                                                *lawrencium_auto_cd*
g:lawrencium_auto_cd    Specifies whether the current working directory should 
                        be set to the repository's root while running |:Hg|
                        commands so that auto-completion works magically with
                        repository relative paths.
                        Defaults to `1`.

                                                *lawrencium_define_mappings*
g:lawrencium_define_mappings
                        Specifies whether Lawrencium should define default
                        keyboard shortcuts.
                        Defaults to `1`.

                                                *lawrencium_hg_commands_file_types*
g:lawrencium_hg_commands_file_types
                        Defines the |file-types| that Lawrencium should use
                        when editing the output of |:Hg!| based on the
                        Mercurial command that was used.
                        
                        By default, unless overridden, the following commands
                        map to the following file types:

                        diff                diff
                        graphlog            graphlog

                                                *lawrencium_annotate_width_offset*
g:lawrencium_annotate_width_offset
                        Specifies the offset to use when computing the width
                        of the annotations window (opened with |:Hgannotate|).
                        Defaults to 0.
                        This is useful for example if you have |'listchars'|
                        set to display characters at the window border when
                        unwrapped lines are extending outside.

                                                *lawrencium_auto_close_buffers*
g:lawrencium_auto_close_buffers
                        Specifies whether to auto-close buffers opened by
                        Lawrencium. For instance, any diff summary buffer open
                        by `Hglog` will be deleted when the log window
                        disappears.
